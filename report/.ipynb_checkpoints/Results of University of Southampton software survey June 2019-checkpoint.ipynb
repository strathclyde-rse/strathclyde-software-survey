    "Without software, most modern research would not be possible. It is the enabling technology behind major advances, from decoding the human genome to the discovery of the Higgs boson, it lies at the heart of strategically important technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and it is a tool of constant use and fundamental importance in day-to-day research. Despite its pivotal role, support for software and software skills has not kept pace with the staggering speed of the digital revolution. This creates a major barrier that prevents the full potential and value of software from being exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2014 study found that 92% of UK researchers use software and 69% report that it is fundamental to their research. The near ubiquity of software in research means that it is not possible to disentangle the quality of the software from the quality of the research. Unreliable and untested software leads to unreliable results that cannot be trusted. Trust cannot be established in poorly engineered software because it is too difficult to understand whether the code is reliable. Without trust, researchers will not build on existing software and will instead recreate it themselves: an avoidable duplication of effort and a waste of funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, the Southampton Research Software Group conducted a survey of all research staff. The results of this survey show that research software is near ubiquitous at the University of Southampton, that it is considered vital to research and that the current provision for supporting software engineering could be considerably improved to benefit both research and enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey was sent to all research staff. In practice this meant sending an email invitation to the mailing lists for all staff employed on an ERE (Education, Research and Enterprise) contract and for all PhD students. The emails were sent on a faculty-by-faculty basis with the following response rate."
