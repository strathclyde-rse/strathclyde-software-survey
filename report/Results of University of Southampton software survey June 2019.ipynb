In 2019, the Southampton Research Software Group conducted a survey of all research staff. The results of this survey show that research software is near ubiquitous at the University of Southampton, that it is judged as vital to research and that the current provision for supporting software engineering could be considerably improved.\n",

Consequently, software development should be encouraged in aademia because it allows researchers to produce the exact software they need, and this saves time, reduces errors and allows research to be conducted at scales that are simply not possible with off-the-shelf software.

Instead, it is necessary to provide researchers with access to experts in general software engineering who can quickly understand and provide support with bespoke software.\n",

Extrapoloating this result over all University research staff indicates that 11% of research staff - around 660 people - have software that they would like to commercialise. Since much research software is developed by lone developers or by very small groups, it seems likely that there could be the potential for 300-600 opportunities for commercialisation across the University. With such a large number of potential codes to draw from, there would appear to be significant potential for commercial success as long as researchers have access to the correct guidance and expertise.\n",
