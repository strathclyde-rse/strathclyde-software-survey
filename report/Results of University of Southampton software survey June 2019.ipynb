    "According to a 2014 study, around 92% of UK researchers use software and 69% report that software is fundamental to their research. In 2019, the Southampton Research Software Group conducted a survey of all research staff. The results of this survey show that research software is near ubiquitous at the University of Southampton, that it is judged as vital to research and that the current provision for supporting software engineering could be considerably improved.\n",

In practice this meant sending an email invitation to the mailing lists for all staff employed on an ERE (Education, Research and Enterprise) contract and for all PhD students. The emails were sent on a faculty-by-faculty basis with the following response rate."
