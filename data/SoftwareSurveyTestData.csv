"This survey should take about 5-10 minutes to complete.     This survey has been developed by staff from multiple Faculties to help us understand the current research software development needs at the University of Strathclyde and how they can be best supported to ensure research grants and KE are competitive. Personal information (email address) is only optionally collected for specific purposes (e.g. prize draw) at the end of the survey and will be deleted once those purposes are fulfilled. Otherwise the survey is anonymous and data will be kept indefinitely. Results will be published in internal reports and presentations and may be included in external publications.
