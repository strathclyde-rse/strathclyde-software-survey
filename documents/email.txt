Dear Collegue,

Most research would not be possible without software. We are trying to
identify the relationship between software and research at the
University of Strathclyde, and would highly appreciate if you could
help us by taking part in this survey:

< LINK >

It should take 5--10 minutes to complete, and your answers are
important to us even if you do not use software. As a thank you,
participants will be entered in a prize draw to win one of four £50
Amazon vouchers.

The survey will remain open until < DATE >.

Thank you,
The Strathclyde Research Software Engineers community
