Research software is an essential and critical resource for Strathclyde. It enables modelling, simulation, data gathering and analysis as well as control of experimental instrumentation. Most research would not be possible without suitable high quality software. Modern codes are a complex infrastructure that requires professional support and maintenance throughout the innovation chain and over its lifecycle.

Despite its importance for academic research, software is often poorly managed. Researchers focus primarily on advancing the science and pay little attention to the IT infrastructure that they create in the process. This builds up a substantial 'technical debt' and has a profoundly negative impact on the feasibility of future research and the reproducibility of current results. Inferior standards of software also limit the possibility to commercialise the products of academic research. Hence, it is not surprising that this practice is increasingly questioned.

Funding bodies have now begun to hold researchers and institutions accountable for the software outputs of research grants. Grant applications that contain a significant amount of software development, but do not have a convincing software engineering and management strategy, are no longer deemed competitive as they do not align with the strategic goals of the funders (see for instance EPSRC's 2018 Software Infrastructure Strategy, https://epsrc.ukri.org/files/research/softwareinfrastructurestrategy2018 and e-Infrastructure Strategy, https://epsrc.ukri.org/files/research/einfrastructurestrategy2018 ). As a leading international technological university, Strathclyde needs excellence in research software engineering to remain competitive.

The Strathclyde community of Research Software Engineers is trying to identify the local relationship between software and research with the aim of supporting future successes for Strathclyde. It would be highly appreciated if you could help this effort by taking part in a short, anonymous survey for research active staff and PGR students. It should take 5--10 minutes to complete and your answers are very important, even if you do not use software. As a thank you, participants may enter a prize draw to win one of ten Â£20 Amazon vouchers.

The survey is accessible following the link

and will remain open until the end of the month.

Various researchers were involved in the design of this survey: Neil Ghani, Oliver Henrich, Ben Hourahine, Romain Michalec, Fredrik Nordvall-Forsberg, Leighton Pritchard and Daniel Thomas. If you have any questions about the survey or research software engineering, please contact the Strathclyde Research Software Engineers community directly on ***REMOVED***.
