Dear RKES and Ethics Committee,

We are planning to conduct a survey on research software engineering (RSE) across all Departments of the University. The primary purpose of the survey is to determine the scope for a centralised RSE service to increase Strathclyde's capacity to produce better software for better research and to increase our competitiveness in funding applications and knowledge exchange activities.

During the last years UK funding councils began to recognise software as a major research infrastructure that needs investment and professional maintenance along its life cycle. Grant applicatons, which contain a software development component, but do not provide a convincing software development and management strategy, are no longer aligned with the strategic goals of the funders. It is also worth recalling that data management plans are essential for data-intensive grants to be deemed fundable.

For further information on software and e-infrastructure stategies I refer to the EPSRC/UKRI website and the UK Society of Research Software Engineering:

Our survey consists of the attached set of questions and is ready to go online. All results are anonymous and emails addresses that we collect during the survey will be deleted from the final data set. Although we have currently no plans to publish the results beyond an internal report, we would like to have the freedom to make them available to a wider professional group, e.g. as part of a national report on RSE.

We would be grateful if you could please let us know whether you see any conflicts with University policies or if you have further suggestions.

Best regards and many thanks,
The Strathclyde Research Software Engineers community
