# Export SVG to PNG

Use *File > Export PNG Image...* in Inkscape, or the command line interface (`--export-area-page` is the default so it can be left out):

```shell
# Export to the original size by using the original resolution,
# typically 72 dpi for photographs
inkscape --export-png=out.png --export-area-page --export-dpi=72 in.svg

# Export to a smaller size by using --export-width or --export-height
inkscape --export-png=out.png --export-area-page --export-width=250 in.svg
```

Small images will benefit from some sharpening to compensate the pixel averaging that comes with size reduction. Use *Filters > Enhance > Sharpen...* or *Filters > Enhance > Unsharp Mask...* in GIMP, but don't overdo it.
